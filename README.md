# GrovePI-for-UWP-CppCx-
This is an Implementation of the GrovePI for Windows IoT in C++/CX. It is directly migrated from the official GrovePi implementation in C#. (Only direct access implemented) 

   I have implemented just the main class for providing direct access to the data ports. 
   
   With this implementation you will be able to read/write and configure the GrovePI+. 
   
   This is directly derivate from the official implementation in C#. This is useful for who may want to use C++/CX in UWP environment. 
   
   I have also included a direct out of the box UWP app, just to be able to interface the board and help to understand the process involved. It is implemented as easy as possible, to help to understand the GrovePICpp class, which is the interface implementation. 
   
   The important files are: GrovePICpp.h and GrovePICpp.cpp. Including those files to any solution should operate fine.
   
   App1, it is just a UWP application with a single windows to test all the functionality.
   
   Any questions/suggestion? More than happy to listen :)
